# DEFI-FOR-ALL-PROJECT
A platform that introduces the concept of blockchain through Decentralized finance to everyone.

Recently, we could see a huge growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in our countries because of how broken the traditional finance system. 
However, we noticed that people who are into cryptocurrencies, only buy and hold them speculating with the price. They don’t invest their assets,
despite the great quantity of opportunities that DeFi offers. 
The problem is the quantity of scams that makes people distrust, and the amount of things to do and information on DeFi could be overwhelming and difficult to understand 
for a beginner. 

So, my inspiration is building a platform where people can understand, learn and invest in DeFi in a simplified way, 
in order to introduce them to this amazing world of decentralized finance.

This project was built and hyperlinked with other platforms such as UNISWAP INTERFACE for the purpose of SWAPPING COINS and also
DEPAY PLATFORM for the purpose of making TRANSACTIONS as a means of DEFI.

Aim/Purpose Of Project
 To make the onboarding to the people with a series of questions by explaining financial concepts.
 To make the process of learning and investing on DeFi simpler and nicer.
 To reduce the ignorance of under-utilizing the full opportunities Decentralized Finance has to offer instead of just buying and holding them and speculating with the price.
 The understanding of Blockchain technology, Cryptocurrency, Decentralized Finance and the likes in a simplified way for anybody and everybody to understand.
 The Ownership and Control of your funds and assets.
