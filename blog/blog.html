                <h2>DEFI FOR ALL NEWS</h2>
                <p>Recently, we could see a huge growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in our countries because of how
                    broken the traditional finance system. However, we noticed that people who are into
                    cryptocurrencies, only buy and hold them speculating with the price. They don’t invest their assets,
                    despite the great quantity of opportunities that DeFi offers. The problem is the quantity of scams
                    that makes people distrust, and the amount of things to do and information on DeFi could be
                    overwhelming and difficult to understand for a beginner. So, my inspiration is building a platform
                    where people can understand, learn and invest in DeFi in a simplified way, in order to introduce
                    them to this amazing world of decentralized finance.
